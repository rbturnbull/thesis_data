# Data Repository: The Textual History of Codex Sinaiticus Arabicus and its Family
The data to accompany Robert Turnbull's PhD thesis: The Textual History of Codex Sinaiticus Arabicus and its Family.

## Chapter 3 - D-Codex
Includes TEI, PDF, and Accordance User Bible files for:
* CSA: Codex Sinaiticus Arabicus (Sinai ar. NF Parch 8/27/28)
* N15<sup>+</sup>: Sinai ar. NF Parch 15/24/36/64
* S71<sup>+</sup>: Sinai ar. 71/Sinai ar. NF Parch 44

NB. These transcriptions have not be validated with a secondary independant transcription. The transcriptions are not intended for publication. They are provided to present the raw data for the numerical analysis. Any close textual study should be done using the D-Codex interface so the manuscript facsimile images can be used for comparison. Uncertain transcriptions are marked with question marks. Gaps in the PDF are marked by underbrackets. Narrow underbrackets $\underbracket(\ \ )$ represent one character and long underbrackets $\underbracket(\ \ \ \ \ \ )$ represent gaps of unknown length.

## Chapter 4 - Verse Metrics
The datasets used for the analysis in this chapter are:
* [Related_TP.csv](Chapter4/Related_TP.csv): The pairs of verse transcriptions from texts in the same family.
* [Unrelated_TP.csv](Chapter4/Unrelated_TP.csv): The pairs of verse transcriptions from texts different families.
